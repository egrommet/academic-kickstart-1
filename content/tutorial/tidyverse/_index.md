To get going you'll need to install [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 

You can have a play with the cloud version of [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.cloud), but my students have found some limitations including upload file size issues.
